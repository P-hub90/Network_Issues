1. Power cycle the router by turning it off for 30 seconds, then turning it back on.
2. Ensure the Wi-Fi network (SSID) is being broadcasted. You should be able to see the network name in your laptop's available networks list.
3. Check the number of devices connected to the router. If the router is overloaded, try disconnecting some devices.
4. Check for router firmware updates. Manufacturers often release updates that can fix issues.
5. Verify router settings such as MAC address filtering, which could block new devices, or any DHCP issues.
6. Make sure your Wi-Fi password is correct and has not been changed.
